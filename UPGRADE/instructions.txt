To upgrade, simply copy all the new files over your existing installation, EXCEPT FOR install.php and config.php

Open the version of config.php currently on your server.  You will need this open because this upgrade requires a new variable to be set.

Open the new config.php found in this zip, and look for the line which starts with "$chan_prefix", copy it to your old configuration file.

Modify your config.php's version from "0.5" to "0.6"

Re-upload your configuration file.

Run the UPGRADE SQL dump found in this folder, and then log in to your manage panel.

Congratulations!  You're now running Trevorchan v0.6
