To upgrade, simply copy all the new files over your existing installation, EXCEPT FOR install.php and config.php

Open the version of config.php currently on your server.  You will need this open because this upgrade requires a reconfiguration.

Open the new config.php found in this zip, and start filling in values you already have.

Upload the new config.php to your server.

Run the SQL dump found in this folder, and then log in to your manage panel.

Congratulations!  You're now running Trevorchan v0.5
