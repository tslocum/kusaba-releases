To upgrade, simply copy all the new files over your existing installation, EXCEPT FOR install.php and config.php

Open up config.php (the version on your server), and go to line 21, change "0.3" to "0.4" (Yes, I know theres a notice.  I'm giving you special permission :D)

Run the SQL dump found in this folder, and then log in to your manage panel.

Go to global options, and change your postbox notice to:

<ul><li>Supported file types are: <!tc_filetypes /></li><li>Maximum file size allowed is <!tc_maximagekb /> KB.</li><li>Images greater than <!tc_maxthumbwidth />x<!tc_maxthumbheight /> pixels will be thumbnailed.</li><li>Currently <!tc_uniqueposts /> unique user posts.</li></ul>
