Installing Trevorchan:

1. Run the included trevorchan.sql file in the mySQL database
2. Open the included config.php and configure to your board setup
3. Upload all files except trevorchan.sql (You can if you want, but you don't need to)
4. Visit where your board is located in your browser and go to install.php (If your board was at www.example.com/board, you would go to www.example.com/board/install.php)
5. The install file should check to make sure you did everything correctly, and then tell you the board is set up, and point you to the next step
6. DELETE the install.php file (If it is re ran, anyone can access the management panel as an administrator)
7. ???
8. PROFIT!!
