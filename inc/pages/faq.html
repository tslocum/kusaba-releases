First, check that it hasn't already been added in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kusaba/wiki/ChangeLog" target="_top">ChangeLog</a>.  If not, post it in <a href="http://img.kusaba.org/c/">/c/</a>, and I'll have a look at it.

<h2><div class="newssub">Does kusaba come with advertisements?</div><div class="permalink">&nbsp;</div></h2>
No.  The kusaba script is advertisement-free, ads are only displayed here at kusaba.org
</div><br>

<div class="content">
<h2><div class="newssub">What is with the advertisements?</div><div class="permalink">&nbsp;</div></h2>
I need the money which they generate to pay the hosting bills, and the rest goes towards a mutual fund which I am going to purchase and then later use for college expenses not covered by my scholarships.<br>
If you find them annoying, you will find relief in the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865" target="_top">Adblock Plus</a> Firefox extension.

<b>Styles</b><br>
I can always use more styles for imageboards, or even text boards.  If you do submit a style and I approve of it, it may not be included by default in the style switcher.  However, I will bundle it with every further release, and anyone can choose to place it in the switcher.<br><br>
<b>Javascript</b><br>
If you are well with Javascript, I need help in making kusaba's Javascript-dependant features cross compatible with browsers and other operating systems.  I develop mainly for Firefox 2.0 under a Windows system, and try to maintain compatibility with IE and Opera as well, however not everything works with either of them.  If you can help make the script more compatible, have an improvement on an existing feature, or have a completely new feature you'd like to have implemented, post about it in <a href="http://img.kusaba.org/c/">/c/</a>.<br><br>
<b>PHP/HTML</b><br>
If you would like to help out with programming, or want to work on the HTML output (such as how the manage panel is formed), post in <a href="http://img.kusaba.org/c/">/c/</a>.  If you want to help with programming, you'll need to first look over the code in the <a href="http://kusaba.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/" target="_top">SVN repository</a>, which houses the development (bleeding edge) version of kusaba.  If you are accepted, you'll be given access to this repository, and will submit all modifications to it.  The repository ensures that all developers are working from the same files, and also allows file difference problems to be resolved easily.<br><br>
<b>Other</b><br>
